    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This one pot chicken orzo dish is wonderfully cheesy and creamy similar to risotto, but you don't need to stir! Lemon gives it brightness and parsley and spinach add color.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup (7 oz.) uncooked orzo</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 lemons, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>3 cups baby spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded fontina cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshley grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in orzo and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in heavy cream, broth, about 1 teaspoon lemon zest, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice; bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the bottom from sticking, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring constantly, until orzo is tender and mixture is thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken and spinach until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in fontina, Parmesan, parsley, pepper, and salt until creamy, about 30 seconds. Serve immediately topped with additional Parmesan and parsley.</li>

    </ol>
